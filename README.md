# My Journey

This repository documents my journey in React.js. Here, I share my struggles, lessons learned, and progress. The purpose is to provide insights into my growth and showcase my development journey to recruiters and others who are interested.

## Struggles

- Struggle 1: React Router wasn't really a struggle, but it was confusing at first. Luckily, before I started this project, I followed a course called Frontend Mentors, which really helped me improve my routing skills a lot. Even though I'm not a pro with it, I know how it functions, and I will get better day by day.
- Struggle 2: Another struggle I had was making NavLinks go on top of the page. Each time I clicked on a NavLink, it would stay on the same page, which was really annoying to fix. I managed to fix it due to Stack Overflow <3

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: React Routing

- This project focused on implementing React routing, which allowed me to create a multi-page website and improve my skills as a frontend developer.
- I learned the importance of proper routing for a website and how it enhances the user experience by enabling navigation between different pages seamlessly.

### Lesson 2: Responsive Design and CSS Styling

- I learned how to use media queries and flexbox to ensure that the website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile platforms.
- By applying responsive design principles and enhancing the visual aesthetics of the website, I was able to create a professional and polished user interface.

## Achievements

- Being able to use React Router was a big achievement for me, and I'm very happy with this project and how it's going right now.


## Goals

- My goals right now are to become better with React, React Router, and API fetching. These are the things I really should work on as a frontend developer.
- Next, I would like to train myself with CRUD operations so I can better my skills as a frontend developer.
- I'm on my summer holiday, so I'm going to take this time to fully study, so by next school year, I could have a fantastic portfolio!
